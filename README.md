# Used-cars-market-analysis
This project showcases a practical solution for predicting car prices using a dataset of Toyota vehicles. The dataset consists of 6738 rows and 9 columns, with variables such as model, year, price, transmission, and engine size. The project explores data validation, ensuring all values align with the data dictionary, and proceeds with feature engineering and model fitting. Two machine learning models, Linear Regression and Decision Tree Regression, are applied to predict car prices based on several features. The project includes exploratory data analysis, data transformation (including log transformation of the target variable), and visualizations that help understand the relationships between features and the price. Evaluation metrics such as R-squared and RMSE are used to measure model performance.

This project was designed to demonstrate how machine learning models can be applied to real-world datasets for price prediction, with the Decision Tree Regression model performing better than Linear Regression in this case. The project ends with a recommendation to use the Decision Tree Regression model for deployment, as it achieves a 69.4% accuracy within a 10% margin of actual car prices. The steps to deploy the model are also outlined, suggesting continuous improvement for better accuracy.
